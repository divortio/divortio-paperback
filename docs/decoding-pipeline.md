# From Paper to File: The Decoding Pipeline

Recovering a digital file from a printed qdPaper page is a reverse-engineering challenge that relies heavily on computer vision and error correction algorithms. The process reconstructs the original data by finding the grid, reading the dots, and repairing any physical damage.

### 1. Image Loading & Grayscale Conversion

* **Action:** The scanned `.bmp` file is loaded into memory and converted into a simple, single-channel grayscale format.
* **Analogy:** Think of this like an MRI scan. Instead of processing complex colors, the computer sees only a map of light and dark intensities (a value from 0 to 255 for each pixel). This simplifies the task of finding the data dots against the paper background. The conversion uses a simple average of the red, green, and blue color channels for each pixel.

### 2. Computer Vision: Grid & Angle Detection

* **Action:** The software analyzes the grayscale image to find the precise location, angle, and perspective of the data grid.
* **Analogy:** This is a pure computer vision task, much like a self-driving car identifying lane lines on a road. The software scans the image for the repeating patterns of black and white dots to calculate the grid's orientation, even if the page was scanned at a slight angle. The algorithm can tolerate a rotation of up to **+/- 7 degrees**.

### 3. Bit Recognition

* **Action:** Using the grid position information from the previous step, the software samples the pixel intensity at the center of each dot's expected location. Based on a calculated threshold, it determines if the dot represents a binary `1` (black) or `0` (white).
* **Purpose:** To convert the analog, visual pattern of dots into a digital stream of ones and zeros.
* **Source Code:** [`/public/js/lib/decoder/recognizeBits.js`](../public/js/lib/decoder/recognizeBits.js)

### 4. Block Assembly

* **Action:** The raw stream of bits is grouped back into 128-byte chunks, reassembling the original 32x32 [Data Blocks](./data-structure.md).
* **Analogy:** This is like piecing together a shredded document. The software knows the exact dimensions of each piece (1024 bits) and reassembles them in the correct order.
* **Source Code:** [`/public/js/lib/decoder/decodeBlock.js`](../public/js/lib/decoder/decodeBlock.js)

### 5. Error Correction Decoding

* **Action:** This is the most critical step for resilience. The decoder uses the 32-byte Reed-Solomon ECC within each block to detect and correct errors.
* **Analogy:** Think of this as a powerful "spell-checker" for physical data. If a coffee stain, scratch, or fold has made some dots unreadable, the decoder uses the redundant ECC data to mathematically reconstruct the missing or incorrect bits, perfectly repairing the damage.

* **Source Code:** [`/public/js/lib/ecc/index.js`](../public/js/lib/ecc/index.js)

### 6. Data De-framing & Reassembly

* **Action:** With all blocks successfully decoded and repaired, the software extracts the core 90-byte data payload from each one, discarding the address, CRC, and ECC bytes. These payloads are then stitched together in the correct order to form a single, continuous data stream.
* **Source Code:** [`/public/js/lib/fileproc/dataRecovery.js`](../public/js/lib/fileproc/dataRecovery.js)

### 7. Decompression & Decryption (Optional)

* **Action:** The reassembled data stream is processed to reverse the optional encoding steps.
    * **Decompression:** If the data was compressed, it is now decompressed using the Gzip algorithm.
    * **Decryption:** If the data was encrypted, the user-provided password is used to decrypt it with AES.
* **Analogy:** This is the final "unwrapping" of the fileâ€”first unzipping it, then unlocking it.
* **Source Code:** [`/public/js/lib/printer/compression.js`](../public/js/lib/printer/compression.js), [`/public/js/lib/printer/encryption.js`](../public/js/lib/printer/encryption.js)

The result is a bit-for-bit perfect copy of the original digital file.
